Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion &#32;through January 27, 2019 . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. 

In November 2018, the Board authorized an additional $7.00 billion &#32;under our share repurchase program and extended it through the end of December 2022. As of January 27, 2019 , we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion . 

We intend to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million of share repurchases we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. 

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
