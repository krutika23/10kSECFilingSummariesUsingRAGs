REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 27, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 27, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 &#32;- Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Our Company 

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. &#32; 

All references to &#8220;NVIDIA,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

Fiscal Year 

We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 52-week years. 

Reclassifications 

Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. 

Principles of Consolidation 

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. 

Revenue Recognition 

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. 

Product Sales Revenue 

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. 

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. 

Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners&#8217; activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. 

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Continued) 

License and Development Arrangements 

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. 

Software Licensing 

Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. 

Advertising Expenses 

We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 &#32;were $ 21 million , $25 million , and $17 million , respectively. 

Product Warranties 

We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. 

Stock-based Compensation 

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs 

From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. 

Foreign Currency Remeasurement 

We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency 

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Continued) 

remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. 

Income Taxes 

We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. 

Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. 

As of January 27, 2019 , we had a valuation allowance of $562 million &#32;related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. 

We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, had provided guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year from the enactment date. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and elected to account for GILTI in deferred taxes. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Net Income Per Share 

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that required us, upon conversion, to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock. Our Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and related Warrants contained various conversion features, which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the Convertible Notes and Warrants under the treasury stock method were included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion was dilutive. However, the Note Hedges were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share unless actually exercised, as their pre-exercised effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. 

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Continued) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

Marketable Securities 

Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. 

All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments&#8217; amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 27, 2019 &#32;and January 28, 2018 . Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders&#8217; equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, aggregated approximately 19% &#32;of our accounts receivable balance from one &#32;customer as of January 27, 2019 &#32;and 28% &#32;of our account receivable balance from two &#32;customers as of January 28, 2018 . We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers&#8217; financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. 

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Continued) 

Accounts Receivable 

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. 

Inventories 

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three &#32;to five &#32;years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty &#32;years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. 

Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. 

Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Refer to Note 5 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets 

Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer relationships. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three &#32;to ten &#32;years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. 

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the

Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

The FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases under which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months. We will adopt this guidance using the optional transition method at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 and will not restate comparative prior periods. Additionally, we will elect the package of practical expedients as permitted by the guidance. We are in the process of finalizing changes to our systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements and currently expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $500 million . 

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. The standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Note 2 - New Revenue Accounting Standard 

Method and Impact of Adoption 

On January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax. Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted. The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 was not significant. 

Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations 

Deferred revenue is comprised mainly of customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS related to software licensing. The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during fiscal year 2019:

This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. 

Refer to Note 16 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures. 

Note 3 &#32;- Stock-Based Compensation 

Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Continued) 

Beginning fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Company&#8217;s level of achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year. 

Of the total fair value of equity awards, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal year 2019 &#32;was $88 million .

##TABLE_END

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield. 

Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. 

Equity Incentive Program 

We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. 

Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan 

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan. 

The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 230 million &#32;shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 27, 2019 , there were 35 million &#32;shares available for future issuance. 

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Continued) 

Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vest over a four -year period, subject to continued service, with 25% &#32;vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% &#32;vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten &#32;years from the date of grant. 

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four -year period, subject to continued service, with 25% &#32;vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% &#32;vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25% &#32;vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% &#32;on approximately the three -year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria. 

Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment. 

Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

Up to 89 million &#32;shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 27, 2019 , we had issued 29 million &#32;shares and reserved 60 million &#32;shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan. 

The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an &#8220;employee stock purchase plan&#8221; under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 &#32;months, which is generally divided into four &#32;purchase periods of six &#32;months. 

Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an offering may have up to 10% &#32;of their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15% . The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% &#32;of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. Employees may end their participation in the 2012 Plan at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In each case, the employee&#8217;s contributions are refunded.

Note 8 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for fiscal year 2019 . Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances.

Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments 

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 . 

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. 

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 :

During fiscal years 2019 &#32;and 2018 , the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no &#32;gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion , after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. 

The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. 

Litigation 

Polaris Innovations Limited 

On May 16, 2016, Polaris Innovations Limited, or Polaris, a non-practicing entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.), filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe six U.S. patents relating to the control of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against NVIDIA. On September 14, 2016, NVIDIA answered the Polaris Complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the six Polaris patents. 

On December 5, 2016, the Texas Court granted NVIDIA&#8217;s motion to transfer and ordered the case transferred to the Northern District of California. 

Between December 7, 2016 and July 25, 2017, NVIDIA filed multiple petitions for inter partes review, or IPR, at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the U.S. litigation. The USPTO instituted IPRs for four U.S. patents and declined to institute IPRs on two U.S. patents. On June 19, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on one IPR, finding claims 1-23 and 28 unpatentable but that claims 24-27 were not proved unpatentable. On November 20, 2018, the USPTO issued Final Written Decisions on two IPRs, finding claims 1, 4, 8-12, 16, 18, 43, 45, and 48-51 unpatentable but that claims 2-3, 5, 14, 17, 19-23, 26-31, and 44 were not proved unpatentable. On December 4, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on one IPR, finding all claims unpatentable.

On December 30, 2016, Polaris filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the Regional Court of D&#252;sseldorf, Germany. Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe three patents relating to control of DRAM. On July 14, 2017, NVIDIA filed defenses to the infringement allegations including non-infringement with respect to each of the three asserted patents. On September 3, 2018, NVIDIA filed a rejoinder with additional noninfringement arguments. On December 4, 2018, NVIDIA filed a further rejoinder with additional noninfringement, nullity, and FRAND arguments. 

An oral hearing is scheduled for February 21, 2019. 

Between March 31, 2017 and June 12, 2017, NVIDIA filed nullity actions with the German Patent Court challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the German litigation. 

ZiiLabs 1 Patents Lawsuit 

On October 2, 2017, ZiiLabs Inc., Ltd., or ZiiLabs, a non-practicing entity, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe four U.S. patents relating to GPUs, or the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. ZiiLabs is a Bermuda corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Asia Limited, a Hong Kong company which is itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Ltd., a publicly traded Singapore company. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or indirect infringement of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On November 27, 2017, NVIDIA answered the ZiiLabs complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. 

On January 10, 2018, ZiiLabs filed a first amended complaint asserting infringement of a fifth U.S. patent. 

On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the ZiiLabs 1 case pending the resolution of the U.S. International Trade Commission, or USITC, investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents. 

On February 1, 2019, NVIDIA entered into an immaterial agreement in which it receives a license to the ZiiLabs patents and a dismissal of the ZiiLabs 1 and 2 Patent Lawsuits. The ZiiLabs 1 and 2 district court cases were dismissed pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal filed on February 8, 2019. The Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Determination on February 12, 2019, granting the motion to terminate the USITC investigation addressing the ZiiLabs 2 patents. 

ZiiLabs 2 Patents Lawsuits 

On December 27, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a second complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed four additional U.S. patents, or the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. The second complaint also seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or indirect infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. 

On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the district court action on the ZiiLabs 2 patents pending the resolution of the USITC Investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents. 

On December 29, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a request with the USITC to commence an Investigation pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the unlawful importation of certain graphics processors and products containing the same. ZiiLabs alleges that the unlawful importation results from the infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents by products from respondents NVIDIA, ASUSTeK Computer Inc., ASUS Computer International, EVGA Corporation, Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd., G.B.T. Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI Computer Corp., Nintendo Co., Ltd., Nintendo of America Inc., PNY Technologies Inc., Zotac International (MCO) Ltd., and Zotac USA Inc.

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits 

On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA&#8217;s officers. The complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between August 10, 2017 and November 15, 2018. The plaintiff also alleges that the NVIDIA officers who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of equitable/injunctive or other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. The two cases have been related and are before the same judge. A stipulation to consolidate the Iron Workers and Oto actions is pending before the Court. On February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel. 

On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on the behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA&#8217;s board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA&#8217;s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February 12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief. 

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. 

Accounting for Loss Contingencies 

We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. As of January 27, 2019, with the exception of immaterial amounts, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $560 million &#32;and $245 million &#32;and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $19 million &#32;and $18 million &#32;for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets are included in Other assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

We recognized an income tax benefit of $245 million &#32;for fiscal year 2019, and income tax expense of $149 million &#32;and $239 million &#32;for fiscal years 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was (6.3)% , 4.7% , and 12.5% &#32;for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. 

In December 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% &#32;to 21% , a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. 

In fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the TCJA by applying the SEC guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and recognized a reduction of $368 million &#32;to the provisional amount recorded at January 28, 2018 as a component of income tax expense (benefit). This adjustment primarily relates to the effects of electing to account for GILTI in deferred taxes, as described below. Our final tax benefit from the TCJA was $501 million . 

The one-time transition tax is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits, or E&#38;P, of our foreign subsidiaries. We had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of these same earnings. We recorded a provisional one-time transition tax liability of $971 million &#32;at January 28, 2018. Upon further analysis of the TCJA and Notices and regulations issued by the US Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, we finalized our calculations of the transition tax liability during fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, we increased our transition tax provisional amount by $33 million . 

As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% , companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. As a result, at January 28, 2018 we had recorded a provisional income tax expense of $43 million &#32;on the write-down of our deferred tax balance. Upon further analysis of certain aspects of the TJCA, including immediate expensing of qualified capital expenditures and refinement of our calculations, we reduced our provisional tax expense amount by $20 million . 

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Continued) 

The TCJA subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. Under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Because we were still evaluating the GILTI provisions as of January 28, 2018, we recorded no &#32;GILTI-related deferred balances. After further evaluation, we elected to account for GILTI deferred taxes. In fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional deferred tax assets as a net $370 million &#32;income tax benefit related to GILTI in deferred taxes. 

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% &#32;to 21% , the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019. 

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% &#32;due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. 

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% &#32;for fiscal year 2018 and 35% &#32;for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. 

As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, we had a valuation allowance of $562 million &#32;and $469 million , respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. 

As of January 27, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $72 million , $291 million &#32;and $290 million , respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2023 and 2020, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $290 million &#32;may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 27, 2019, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $347 million &#32;that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2037. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $718 million , of which $687 million &#32;is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $31 million &#32;is attributable to various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal year 2020. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization. 

As of January 27, 2019, we had $477 million &#32;of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $432 million &#32;would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, approximately $82 million &#32;of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $432 million &#32;of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 27, 2019 consisted of $142 million &#32;recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $290 million &#32;reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.

##TABLE_END

We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year. 

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 27, 2019 , January 28, 2018 , and January 29, 2017 , we had accrued $21 million , $15 million , and $13 million , respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 27, 2019 , unrecognized tax benefits of $142 million &#32;and the related interest and penalties of $21 million &#32;are included in non-current income taxes payable. 

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 27, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. 

We are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States and throughout the world. As of January 27, 2019, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2018. As of January 27, 2019, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India, Taiwan, China and UK for fiscal years 2003 through 2018.

Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. 

Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. 

The &#8220;All Other&#8221; category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. 

Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the &#8220;All Other&#8221; category.
